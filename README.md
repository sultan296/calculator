# calculator

I will walk you through the creation of a dynamic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Together, I have builded an intuitive interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with ease.

Starting with the HTML layout, I will demonstrate how to set up the structure to house our calculator, including input fields and buttons for numbers and operations. Next, we’ll transition to styling the design using CSS, ensuring our calculator is visually appealing and user-friendly. As it proceed, It will show how to implement JavaScript to add interactive functionality, enabling the calculator to process user input and display results. Together, It cover essential features such as clearing the display, deleting the last entry, and calculating results using the “equal” button.
